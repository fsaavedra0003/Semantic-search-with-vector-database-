# 🧠 BERT + Milvus Semantic Search 🚀

## Overview 📚
This project demonstrates how to implement **semantic search** using **BERT embeddings** and **Milvus** as a vector database. The goal is to retrieve semantically similar results to a user query based on the meaning of the text rather than exact keyword matches. 

By combining **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, a state-of-the-art natural language processing model, with **Milvus**, a high-performance vector database, we can build a scalable semantic search engine.

## Features 🌟
- Generate **BERT embeddings** for text data.
- Store and query text embeddings using **Milvus**.
- Perform **semantic search** to retrieve relevant results based on meaning.
- Scalable and fast, perfect for large-scale data retrieval.
